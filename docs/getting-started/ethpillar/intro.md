# Overview

This section covers the latest and recommended methods for setting up and running Endurance validator nodes. These new approaches offer several advantages over the traditional method:

- **Simplified Setup**: Modern tools that streamline the node setup process
- **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Graphical or text-based interfaces that reduce the need for complex command-line operations
- **Automated Management**: Tools that handle updates, monitoring, and maintenance with minimal user intervention

The methods described in this section are recommended for both new validators and experienced operators looking for more efficient ways to manage their nodes. The all-in-one tool we'll be using is [EthPillar-Endurance](https://github.com/OpenFusionist/EthPillar-Endurance), which provides a comprehensive solution for node management.

Please explore the guides in this section to find the approach that best suits your needs.
