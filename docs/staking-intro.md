# Staking Intro

Endurance building based on Ethereum technology uses PoS mechanisms similar to Ethereum, allowing a validator to earn rewards in the network by staking 32 ACE.

## Reward

### Base Reward

You can check the current APR data with this tool, which calculates rewards every day based on node real reward data: [ACE.STORE](https://beacon.fusionist.io/ethstore)

You can also calculate your staking reward based on the current ACE price using this calculator: [Staking Calculator](https://beacon.fusionist.io/calculator)

### Solo Staker Extra Reward

For solo stakers who verify their execution address on the Discord channel, the Endurance Community will **double** your reward every month. For example, if the on-chain reward APR is 15%, you will get up to 30% after participating in the Staking Incentive Reward.

## Decentralized

Endurance had 33,000 validators in the genesis block owned by Fusionist when Endurance 2.0 launched on May 4, 2024. Endurance hopes the network will be decentralized enough. This chart shows the process status:
