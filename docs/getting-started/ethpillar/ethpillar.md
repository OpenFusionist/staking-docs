EthPillarâ€™s TUI provides comprehensive step-by-step instructions. Additionally, we have recorded a video guide for your convenience. *(TODO: add video link)*

Here are some screenshots of key steps:

## Generate Validator Key & Send Deposit

EthPillar integrates with [ethstaker-deposit-cli](https://github.com/OpenFusionist/ethstaker-deposit-cli) to assist users in managing Validators within the TUI. This includes generating and importing Validator keys, as well as making deposits.

To proceed, run `ethpillar`, select `Validator Client -> Generate / Import Validator Keys`, and follow the instructions. EthPillar will automatically load the generated keys into the validator.

Following the TUI prompts, you can choose to send your deposit request on-chain via [launchpad](https://staking.fusionist.io) (recommended for most users).

For advanced users who need to manage multiple keys simultaneously, we provide a batch sending [tool](https://github.com/OpenFusionist/staking-batch-depositer).

## Withdraw Deposit

EthPillar integrates with [ethdo](https://github.com/wealdtech/ethdo) to facilitate the withdrawal process for Validators within the TUI.

To withdraw, run `ethpillar`, select `Validator Client -> Generate Voluntary Exit Messages (VEM)` and `Validator Client -> Broadcast Voluntary Exit Messages (VEM)`, and follow the instructions.

:::note
EthPillar will withdraw all keys located in your specified validator keys folder.
