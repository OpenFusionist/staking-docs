# About Staking

Endurance building based on Ethereum technology uses PoS mechanisms similar to Ethereum, allowing a validator to earn rewards in the network by staking 32 ACE.

## Base Reward

You can check the current APR data with this tool, which calculates rewards every day based on node real reward data: [ACE.STORE](https://beacon.fusionist.io/ethstore)

You can also calculate your staking reward based on the current ACE price using this calculator: [Staking Calculator](https://beacon.fusionist.io/calculator)

## Solo Staker Extra Reward

For solo stakers who verify their execution address on the Discord channel, the Endurance Community will double your reward every month. For example, if the on-chain reward APR is 15%, you will get up to 30% after participating in the Staking Incentive Reward.
