# Send Deposit

Use your `deposit_data-` file generated earlier, and follow this guide to send your deposit request on-chain:

- https://staking.fusionist.io/


And you can check your validator's deposit status in this page:

- https://beacon.fusionist.io/validators/deposits

Make sure the `Valid Signature` is âœ…. You just need to wait for 1 day if there are no other pending validators; your validator will become active.
